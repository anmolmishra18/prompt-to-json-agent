=== Day 1 - Setup + Merge Foundations ===
Honesty: Successfully created base pipeline with main.py loading JSONs into evaluator. Folder structure aligned with all required directories.
Discipline: Committed folder structure, sample JSONs, and working main.py by EOD as planned.
Gratitude: Learned about JSON schema validation architecture and modular pipeline design.

=== Day 2 - Evaluator + Report Generator ===
Integrity: Implemented schema validation and scoring without faking results. All test runs show actual performance.
Discipline: Pushed working criteria.py and report.py with 5+ test specs generating reports in /reports/.
Gratitude: Thanks to Olivia and Saad for evaluation logic contributions mentioned in README.

=== Day 3 - Feedback Loop + RL Agent ===
Honesty: RL feedback loop working with visible before/after improvements across 2-3 iterations.
Discipline: Feedback logs properly maintained in /logs/ for each run with complete history.
Gratitude: Credit to jsonschema library and Python documentation for implementation guidance.

=== Day 4 - Deployment Ready + Docs ===
Integrity: CLI demo shows honest results without pre-baked outputs. Streamlit app functional.
Discipline: Repo builds from fresh clone with all dependencies in requirements.txt.
Gratitude: Acknowledge team contributions and open-source libraries (jsonschema, streamlit) in README.

=== Final Status ===
All 4-day requirements completed:
✓ Working CLI: python main.py --prompt "text" --iterations 3
✓ Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
✓ Schema validation + scoring in evaluator/criteria.py
✓ Report generation in both .txt and .json formats
✓ RL feedback loop with improvement tracking
✓ Complete documentation and error handling
